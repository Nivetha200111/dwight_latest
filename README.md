# 🔥 DWIGHT UX - Neural ACO Emergency Response System

> Y2K-themed emergency evacuation simulation powered by Neural Networks, Ant Colony Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dwight-ux)

## 🎨 Features

- **🧠 Neural Predictive ACO**: LSTM network predicts fire spread 30-60 seconds ahead
- **📡 IoT Sensor Fusion**: Simulated temperature, smoke, CO, and motion sensors with Kalman filtering
- **🤖 RL Evacuation Coordinator**: Q-learning agent optimizes warden deployment
- **🎯 Y2K Aesthetic**: Purple, cyan, and magenta themed interface with glowing effects
- **⚡ Real-time Simulation**: 240-step evacuation simulation with live results

## 🚀 Quick Start - Deploy to Vercel

**Want to deploy this so others can access it?** See [DEPLOY_TO_VERCEL.md](DEPLOY_TO_VERCEL.md)

1. Fork this repository
2. Connect to Vercel
3. Deploy! (it takes ~1 minute)

## 💻 Local Development

See [HOW_TO_RUN.md](HOW_TO_RUN.md) for local setup instructions.

## 📊 How It Works

The system combines three cutting-edge AI techniques:

1. **LSTM Neural Network** - Predicts fire spread patterns
2. **Ant Colony Optimization** - Finds optimal evacuation paths
3. **Q-Learning** - Optimizes resource allocation

Together, they create an adaptive emergency response system that learns and improves in real-time.
